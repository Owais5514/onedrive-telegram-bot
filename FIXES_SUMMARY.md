# Bot Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Button_data_invalid Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Telegram callback data exceeded 64-byte limit causing `Button_data_invalid` errors
- 662 items would exceed the limit (longest: 197 bytes)
- Files with long names like "Fall-22 CHEM 1107 Semester Final Question.pdf" caused failures

**Solution**: Implemented callback data mapping system
- Added `create_callback_data()` and `resolve_callback_data()` methods
- Short data uses direct encoding, long data gets mapped to short IDs
- Applied to all button types (files, folders, back buttons)

## Issue 2: Post-Download Navigation ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: After file download, users had to use /start to browse again

**Solution**: Enhanced download flow with folder tracking
- Track current folder path during file selection
- Provide "Back to Folder" button after download completion
- Include Main Menu option for easy navigation
- Store folder context in download callback data

## Issue 3: File Size Validation ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Files larger than 50MB failed silently without clear error message

**Solution**: Pre-download validation and clear messaging
- Check file size before download attempt
- Show clear warning for files > 50MB
- Display actual file size in buttons and messages
- Provide navigation options when files are too large

## Test Results

✅ **Bot Status**: Running successfully without errors
✅ **File Browsing**: All 1965 files can be displayed in buttons
✅ **Navigation**: Three-column layout working (Back | Main Menu | Refresh)
✅ **Downloads**: Files sent successfully with proper navigation
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear messages for oversized files

## Code Changes

### Core Methods Added:
- `create_callback_data(prefix, data)` - Creates short callback data
- `resolve_callback_data(callback_data)` - Resolves to original data

### Enhanced Methods:
- `handle_file_download()` - Now includes size validation and folder tracking
- `download_and_send_file()` - Includes navigation and better error handling
- `show_folder_contents()` - Uses callback mapping for all buttons

### Navigation Flow:
1. Browse folders → Select file → Size check → Download confirmation
2. If file too large → Warning message + navigation options  
3. If download successful → Success message + "Back to Folder" option
4. If download fails → Error message + navigation options

The bot now provides a smooth, error-free experience with proper file size handling and navigation continuity.
