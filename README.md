‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bot.py              # Main bot application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example       # Environment variables template

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing required environment variables"**
   - Make sure your `.env` file exists and contains all required variables
   - Check that variable names match exactly

2. **"Error accessing OneDrive"**
   - Verify your Azure app has the correct permissions
   - Ensure admin consent was granted for the permissions
   - Check that Client Secret hasn't expired

3. **"Bot doesn't respond"**
   - Verify your Telegram bot token is correct
   - Make sure the bot is not already running elsewhere

4. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Double-check Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID
   - Ensure the Azure app is configured correctly

### Debug Mode:

Set `DEBUG=True` in your `.env` file to enable detailed logging.

## Security Notes

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- Azure client secrets have expiration dates - monitor and renew them
- The bot uses application permissions, so it can access OneDrive on behalf of the organization
- Download links are temporary and expire automatically
