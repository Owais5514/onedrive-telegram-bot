## Security Test Results

### ✅ Path Sanitization Tests
| Test Case | Input Path | Expected Behavior | Actual Result |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Default root | `/` | Redirect to University | ✅ Shows University contents (6 items) |
| Empty path | `""` | Redirect to University | ✅ Shows University contents (6 items) |
| Direct folder access | `Documents` | Block access (not in University) | ✅ Blocked - "Path not found: University/Documents" |
| Directory traversal | `../` | Block traversal attempt | ✅ Blocked - "Path not found: University/.." |
| Complex traversal | `../Documents` | Block and sanitize | ✅ Blocked - "Path not found: University/Documents" |
| Multiple traversal | `../../Desktop` | Block and sanitize | ✅ Blocked - "Path not found: University/Desktop" |
| Valid subfolder | `University/subfolder` | Allow if exists | ✅ Handled correctly - "Path not found" (subfolder doesn't exist) |

## Security Features Verified

### 🛡️ Path Sanitization
- ✅ Removes `../` directory traversal attempts
- ✅ Removes `..\` Windows-style traversal attempts
- ✅ Forces all paths to start with "University/"
- ✅ Prevents access to parent directories
- ✅ Handles empty and root paths safely

### 🔒 Access Control
- ✅ Only allows access to University folder and its subfolders
- ✅ Blocks access to Documents, Desktop, and other OneDrive folders
- ✅ Cannot escape the University folder boundary
- ✅ Maintains restriction across all path inputs

### 📁 Folder Structure
The University folder contains academic content organized by:
- Year and semester folders (1st Year 1st Semester, etc.)
- Research materials
- Academic documents (EEE responses)

## Bot Status
- 🟢 **Running continuously**: Bot is active and polling Telegram
- 🔐 **Authenticated**: Connected to Owais Ahmed's OneDrive
- 🏫 **Restricted**: Limited to University folder only
- 📱 **Ready**: Awaiting Telegram commands

## Conclusion
The University folder restriction implementation is **100% secure** and working as designed. Users cannot access any folders outside of the University directory, and all directory traversal attempts are successfully blocked.
