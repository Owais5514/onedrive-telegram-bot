## üìã Why Archived?

These files were moved here to:
- ‚úÖ **Keep main directory clean** - Focus on essential files
- ‚úÖ **Reduce confusion** - Avoid duplicate documentation
- ‚úÖ **Preserve history** - Maintain development record
- ‚úÖ **Organize better** - Structured documentation in `/docs`

## üîÑ Restoration

If you need any of these files for reference:
```bash
# View archived implementation analysis
cat archived/implementation-docs/PERSISTENT_STORAGE_ANALYSIS.md

# Copy back if needed (not recommended)
cp archived/implementation-docs/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md .
```

**Recommendation**: Use the organized documentation in `/docs` directory instead.
