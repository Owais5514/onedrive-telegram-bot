Usually the File Structure will giveaway where which types of files are stored. Usually file names contain their course code (CE1201, EEE2203, MATH1103 etc in these formats), which are followed by a letter and numbers (For example EEE2203 L01 means its a lecture file and lecture number 1, MATH1103 Q1 means its a math quiz question and its quiz 1 etc). The folder names should give away what letter means.
